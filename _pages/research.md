## Working Papers
1. **Xiaoquan Gao**, Pengyi Shi, Nan Kong, ["Stopping the revolving door: MDP-Based decision support for community corrections placement"](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/CC_Manuscript.pdf), *In preparation for submission*
  - *First place, 2023 IISE Outstanding Innovation in Service Systems Engineering Award*
  - *Finalist, 2023 INFORMS Service Science Best Student Paper Award*
  - Study the placement decisions for community corrections and associated capacity planning via an MDP model and establish structural properties for policy insights
  - Propose a two-timescale approximation scheme for algorithmic solutions with global optimality guaranteed by the value function superconvexity
  - Mitigate the incarceration congestion and improve individual outcomes through dynamic placment policy and provide insights into capacity planning in the criminal justice system

2. **Xiaoquan Gao**, Nan Kong, Paul M. Griffin, ["Shortening emergency medical response time with joint operations of UAVs with ambulances"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAs2ELgQvs7HpcW9WJNbHgCPcwNnKHWO/view?usp=share_link), Minor revision at *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management*.
  - Extend the MDP-based EMS operations analytics framework for joint operations and design a set of effective basis functions in consideration of service heterogeneity of ambulances and UAVs (drones)
  - Demonstrate the advantages of incorporating UAVs into the EMS system and provide guidance for EMS agencies on how to incorporate UAVs into their operations
