## Working Papers
1. **Xiaoquan Gao**, Pengyi Shi, Nan Kong, "Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Community Corrections Placement Support with an MDP Approach", *In preparation for submission*
  - *First place, Outstanding Innovation in Service Systems Engineering Award, IISE (2023)*
  - Study the placement decisions for community corrections and associated capacity planning via an MDP model and establish structural properties for policy insights
  - Propose a two-timescale approximation scheme for algorithmic solutions with global optimality guaranteed by the value function convexity
  - Mitigate the incarceration congestion and improve individual outcomes through dynamic placment policy and provide insights into capacity planning in the criminal justice system

2. **Xiaoquan Gao**, Nan Kong, Paul M. Griffin, ["Shortening emergency medical response time with joint operations of UAVs with ambulances"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAs2ELgQvs7HpcW9WJNbHgCPcwNnKHWO/view?usp=share_link), Second round revision at *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management*.
  - Extend the MDP-based EMS operations analytics framework for joint operations and design a set of effective basis functions in consideration of service heterogeneity of ambulances and UAVs (drones)
  - Demonstrate the advantages of incorporating UAVs into the EMS system and provide guidance for EMS agencies on how to incorporate UAVs into their operations
