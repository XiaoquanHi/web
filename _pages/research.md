<!--
  - Study the placement decisions for community corrections and associated capacity planning via a novel MDP model in this understudied area
  - Propose a unified structural property analysis method for MDP with non-memoryless dynamics and non-linear costs
  - Propose a two-timescale approximation scheme for reinforcement learning-based algorithmic solutions with global optimality implicated
  - Implement the algorithm into a user-friendly dashboard and provide staffing suggestions for local community corrections
