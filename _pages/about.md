Welcome! My name is Xiaoquan Gao. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [School of Industrial Engineering](http://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at Purdue University. I am advised by Prof. [Nan Kong](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BASO/people/Nan_Kong), Prof. [Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/), and Prof. [Paul M. Griffin](https://www.ime.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=pmg14). Previously, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.

**I am on the 2023-2024 job market.**
## Research Interest
My research aims to enable data-driven, _socially responsible operations_ in public systems, from _healthcare_ to _criminal justice_. Despite their importance to societal welfare, decision-making in public systems often lacks analytical support and is not well-established in the operations literature. I believe that data-driven analytical support can drive meaningful changes to these systems, especially in addressing _complex tradeoffs_ and _resource constraints_. Central to my research are tools from data analytics, stochastic modeling, and reinforcement learning. In particular, my work has focused on (i) designing models that encapsulate the dynamic nature of public service operations; (ii) developing actionable algorithms tailored to the decision problem's structure.

I have been working closely with _community partners_, ensuring that my research is both grounded in practice and positioned for _tangible implementation_. By bridging the theory and practice, I identify promising research directions where cross-disciplinary perspectives can uncover novel approaches to persistent challenges.
