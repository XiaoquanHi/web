Welcome! My name is Xiaoquan Gao. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [School of Industrial Engineering](http://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at Purdue University. I am advised by Prof. [Nan Kong](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BASO/people/Nan_Kong), Prof. [Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/), and Prof. [Paul M. Griffin](https://www.ime.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=pmg14). Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.

**I am on the 2023-2024 job market.**

Research Interests
======

My primary research interests focus on leveraging stochastic modeling, optimization, and reinforcement learning to support decisions making in public service operations such as healthcare and criminal justice. In particular, my work has focused on 
  - modeling dynamic systems that involve public service providers;
  - developing flexible algorithms tailored to the decision problem’s structure;
  - bridging the gap between current practice and optimized decision-making through community-engaged research. 

By leveraging these tools, I aim to understand the intricacies of real-world systems and provide actionable solutions that enhance long-term outcomes.
