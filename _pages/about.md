Welcome! My name is Xiaoquan Gao. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [School of Industrial Engineering](http://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at Purdue University. I am advised by Prof. [Nan Kong](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BASO/people/Nan_Kong), Prof. [Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/), and Prof. [Paul M. Griffin](https://www.ime.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=pmg14). Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.

Research Interests
======

My primary research interests focus on leveraging stochastic modeling and reinforcement learning to support decisions making in healthcare and public service operations. Broadly, the goal is to provide actionable policy recommendations to improve system's long-term outcomes. 

My current research combines tools from stochastic models, optimization, and reinforcement learning. In particular, my work has focused on (i) modeling dynamic systems with non-conventional service providers, and (ii) developing flexible algorithms tailored to the decision problem’s structure.
