Welcome! My name is Xiaoquan Gao. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [School of Industrial Engineering](http://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at Purdue University. I am advised by Prof. [Nan Kong](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BASO/people/Nan_Kong), Prof. [Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/), and Prof. [Paul M. Griffin](https://www.ime.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=pmg14). Previously, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.

**I am on the 2023-2024 job market.**

Research Interests
======

My research aims to enable data-driven, **socially responsible operations** in public systems, from healthcare to criminal justice. Despite their importance to societal welfare, decision-making in public systems often lacks analytical support and is not well-established in the research literature. I believe that data-driven analytical support can drive meaningful changes to these systems, especially in addressing **complex tradeoffs and resource constraints**. Central to my research are tools from data science, stochastic modeling, and reinforcement learning. In particular, my work has focused on 
  - designing models that encapsulate the dynamic nature of public service operations;
  - developing actionable algorithms tailored to the decision problem's structure;

I have been working closely with **community partners**, ensuring that my research is both grounded in practice and positioned for **tangible implementation**. By bridging the theory and practice, I identify promising research directions where cross-disciplinary perspectives can uncover novel approaches to persistent challenges.
