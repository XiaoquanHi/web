Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management of the [Lee Kong Chian School of Business (LKCSB)](https://business.smu.edu.sg) at the [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg). 

My research aims to enable _data-driven, socially responsible operations_ in public systems, from _healthcare_ to _criminal justice_. Central to my research are tools from data analytics, stochastic modeling and control, and reinforcement learning. In particular, my work has focused on (i) modeling the dynamic and uncertain environments underlying public and service operations, (ii) characterizing the optimal policies and structural properties that guide effective decisions, and (iii) designing computationally tractable algorithms informed by these theoretical insights. Beyond methodological advances, I collaborate with practitioners across healthcare, criminal justice, and social sectors to translate these tools into solutions that enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and long-term sustainability.

Before joining SMU, I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in 2024, advised by Prof. Nan Kong, Prof. [Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/), and Prof. [Paul M. Griffin](https://www.ime.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=pmg14). Prior to that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Peking University in 2019.
